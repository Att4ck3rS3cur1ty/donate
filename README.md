## [~]$ whoami
Hey there! I'm an Open Source enthusiast hacker/security researcher/programmer/curious regarding multiple topics from the cyber world.
I have plus than 12 years of hacking and I've already worked for big companies as a software engineer, pentester and security specialist.

Nowadays I've been building a lot of open source tools, free to use and share, focused mainly on the information security side, but not restricted to it only.
If you feel you should help this fun guy here, I appreciate it.
